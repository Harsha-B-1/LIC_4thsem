# THE MOS DIFFERENTIAL PAIR AMPLIFIER <br>
1. A differential amplifier amplifies the differential-mode voltage while rejecting common-mode signals,characterized by a high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and differential gain.
2. It is built using matched BJTs or MOSFETs, often incorporating a current mirror for biasing and an active load for improved gain and linearity.
## Applications
Used in operational amplifiers, instrumentation amplifiers, and analog front-end circuits, it enhances noise immunity and precision in signal processing systems.
### Q) Design a differential amplifier for the following specifications 
Vdd =2.5V | Vincm=1.3V | Vp=0.5V| P<=3mW|Vocm=1.4V

Perform DC analysis , Transient analysis , frequency response and extract the parameters.
